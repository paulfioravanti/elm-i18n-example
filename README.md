# Elm I18n Example

An example implementation of runtime language switching using [Elm][].

It re-implements [Tachyons][]'
[Full Screen Centered Title component documentation page][] in Elm, adds a
language dropdown menu, and allows you to switch the language of the message
displayed.

It was created as part of a blog post I wrote about
[Runtime Language Switching in Elm][]. The post references the example when it
was using Elm 0.18, so that application state is preserved in the [0.18 branch].
